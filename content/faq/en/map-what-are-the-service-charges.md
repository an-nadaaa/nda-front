question: What are the service charges of An-Nadaa?
answer: An-Nadaa has zero service charges. If a donor sends $X amount for a project then the amount that we receive after bank charges and payment processor charges is completely used for that project. We do not deduct any service charges or operational expenses from the amount received.
