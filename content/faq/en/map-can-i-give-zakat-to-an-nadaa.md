question: Can I give Zakat to an-Nadaa?
answer: Yes you can give zakat to An-Nadaa but you need to clearly specify that this money is for Zakat so we can separate it and use it only for the places where Zakat is eligible. To learn more about our zakat program you can see our [Zakat program details]().
