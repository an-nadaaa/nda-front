question: How does An-Nadaa cover its expenses?
answer: Most of An-Nadaa team is working on volunteer basis. The few employees who are salaried are covered by a few of our generous donors. The remaining operational expenses are taken up by the team. For long term sustainability An-Nadaa will cover its operational expenses through Waqf projects. You can learn more about Waqf from [this workshop](https://youtu.be/s_d7nxrK8ok) and see our waqf projects through this [link](./causes)
