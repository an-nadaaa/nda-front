You can invest in your akhirah and make a difference for the people of Zaria and its surrounding villages. Help An-Nadaa establish a clinic that will provide affordable & quality health care to our brothers and sisters in Zaria.



Access and affordability of basic health services is one of the biggest problems in Northern Nigeria and this is even more severe for women & children. An-Nadaa has been helping out on a case to case basis but this can help only a few. To fulfill the needs of the community a medical facility is required that will give quality medical care at an affordable price and also respect the patients' right to modesty, respect and safety.

This clinic is being built under the direct supervision of our director Sheikh Ibrahim Nuhu with technical supervision and advice from

* Prof. Madya Dr. Ahmad Asmadi bin Yusof - Deputy Dean for Department of Medicine and Health at Malaysia National Defense University
* Prof. Dr. Abdullahi Jibril Randawa - Lecturer Faculty of Obstetrics & Gynecology - Provost(Dean) College of Health Science Ahmadu Bello University Zaria
* Dr. Ahmadu Usman Dahiru - Lecturer Faculty of Medicine (Anatomy) Ahmadu Bello University Zaria

\
This is the first clinic which will be followed by many more inn shaa Allah. With these clinics we hope to reduce the suffering for residents of Zaria. They struggle to get good medical treatment due to non availability or high costs.

An-Nadaa began working on its first Clinic project in 2020. Alhamdu lillah the construction is completed and you can see regular updates on the progress of this project through our social media pages and our monthly newsletter. 

This medical center is dedicated to maternity and childcare services. It will be located at Maji road,Tudun Wada community in Zaria. This clinic will be a 2 Storey Facility with
