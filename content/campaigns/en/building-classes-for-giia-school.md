Help us nurture leaders for the future by expanding the GIIA school. The Global Insight International Academy is currently operating with classes from pre-nursery up to grade 2 requires a 3 storey building. 



The GIIA is established to provide quality education and nurture future leaders of their field while being mini scholars at the same time. The additional building will help us increase the capacity of the school with additional grades, including rooms for community classes.



Build your Hereafter today by investing in this project as a sadaqah jariyah to build the next generation of our Ummah. Rasulullah ﷺ said, "When the son of Adam dies, his deeds come to an end except for three things, one of them being Sadaqah Jariyah. You can be part of the sadaqah jariyah by helping us to spread knowledge and empowering the future leaders of the Ummah
