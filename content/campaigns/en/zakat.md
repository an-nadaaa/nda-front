## Importance Of Zakah

Islam has five pillars which must be preserved to ensure its existence, and Zakah is one of those pillars. It is the highest level of charity and takes precedence over every other charity. Generally speaking, charity is used by Islam for the purpose of poverty alleviation, and Zakah is the most powerful tool used to achieve this goal. 

The Qur'an says "it is for Allah, His Messenger, the kindred, the orphans, Al-Masakin (the needy), and the wayfarer, in order that it may not become a fortune used by the rich among you." \[59:7] 

The importance of Zakah can be seen through its following objectives:

• Increase in Iman

• Creating brotherhood among members of the community

• Poverty alleviation

• Provision of social security in the community

• Purification of both the wealth and the giver of the wealth

• Increase and growth in wealth

Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "Sadaqah does not decrease wealth, and Allah increases the honor of him who forgives, and no one will humble himself for Allah's sake except that Allah raises his status." Related by Muslim.

The Qur'an says "The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, is as the likeness of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. Allah gives manifold increase to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower". \[2:261] 

## How An-Nadaa distributes the Zakah collected?

An-Nadaa focuses and restricts distribution to only those mentioned by the Qur'an in the following Ayah "As-sadaqat (here it means Zakah) are only for the fuqara' (poor), and al-masakin (the needy) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah's cause (i.e. for mujahidun), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise.” \[9:60] 

We try as best as we can to stay away from any doubts or controversies among the scholars, and instead focus on the areas of their consensus to avoid any mistakes or failings in delivering the Amanah. 

Among those mentioned by the Ayah we focus on the following:

1. Al-Fuqara': Those who have nothing to suffice their basic needs and the Masakin (the needy), especially the du’at, teachers in Islamic centers, sick people at home or at hospital, widows, orphans, the disabled, and poor students of knowledge who dedicate themselves to learning the deen and educating the ummah among others. 

2. Al-Mu'allafatu QuIubuhum: These are people that we believe, if given Zakah, will be motivated to accept Islam if they are not yet Muslims. Or they may become righteous and good believers who will use their authority and power to support Islam and its affairs. The people intended here are those whose hearts are to be reconciled, such as leaders of tribes and their likeness, and whose acceptance of Islam or the truth will greatly benefit the community and Islam.

3. Al-Gharimun: Those who are overburdened by their legal debts and are unable to pay them.
