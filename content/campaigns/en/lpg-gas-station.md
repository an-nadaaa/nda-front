All earnings from this LPG station will be dedicated to covering An-Nadaa’s operational costs, as well as serving the community through welfare projects from any surplus amounts.

Once operational, this Waqf will allow us In Shaa Allah to shift our attention from worrying about operational costs to dedicating our energy and time towards serving the Muslims instead. 

Your donations to this Waqf project are not just one-off donations. Rather, they are Sadaqah Jariya (continuous charity) that can benefit you even after death for many years to come. 

**The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, "When a man dies, his deeds come to an end except for three things: Sadaqah Jariyah, a knowledge which is beneficial, or a righteous child who prays for him”**

Do not miss out on this golden opportunity to invest in your hereafter!
