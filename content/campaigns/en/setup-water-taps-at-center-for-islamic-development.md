Help us provide a safe water resource for the Center of islamic Development in Zaria. This is a center that has many institutes running inside it from schools to tahfeez to Islamiyah classes. There are 2000 students benefiting from this center who will drink water from this source and also perform wudu,



Currently this center has a manual well from which the students pull buckets of water. This is not only a safety hazard but also consumes a lot of time from the students and is insufficient for the requirements. There is a need to replace the old manual well with a modern system. We propose to have a deep bore hole that fills an overhead tank using an electric pump. This overhead water tank can then supply water to the school and also to the community.



This center is located in the heart of the city and there are more than 4000 houses within 10 minutes walking distance from this center. So this will benefit a huge amount of people. The community is really suffering from acute water shortage. There is no communal water piping and people buy water for drinking, cooking and washing. We have even heard of cases of people who are not even able to buy water for their family to open fast with in the days of Ramadan.Â 



So this project will be a huge source of relief for the people in this community. A sadaqah jariyah that will bring relief to the people and to the one who make it possible on the day of Qiyaamah inn shaa Allah.
